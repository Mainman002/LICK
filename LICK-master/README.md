#Live Coding Kit For Löve

A small live coding library for Löve which also enables interactive debugging. It basically just is a customized [love.run](https://love2d.org/wiki/love.run) which presses all errors to the command line(or in debug mode on screen). And reloads the “main.lua” everytime you save.

note: still in development - everything can change

#My youtube example project of headchant's pretty epic Löve2D library!
